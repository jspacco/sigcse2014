<p>All SIGCSE members are encouraged to participate in the reviewing process.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>For New Reviewers</strong>

  <ul>

<p>Submissions are reviewed according to categories indicated by the authors.  Reviewers will be assigned no more than three papers or six submissions of another type, based on their indicated subject areas of expertise. At least four reviewers are assigned to each.  Papers are only available in electronic PDF format.  Reviewers must use a Web browser and software capable of displaying PDF documents (For example: <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/?promoid=BUIGO" target="_blank">Adobe Reader</a>).</p>
<p>The reviewing process has 3 simple steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li> When reviews are assigned, you will be sent an email from the system indicating that you have been assigned submissions to review and given a link that you can use to access those assigned submissions. Become familiar with the review criteria by looking at the 
<?php if ($reviewSiteReady) {
 echo $reviewerURL;
} else {
 echo "<em>proposal review forms (link coming soon)</em>";
}
?> for each category of submission.
Read through the collections of example review text for the types of submissions you are reviewing. Included are examples of comments for good, useful reviews.</li>

   <li><a href="guide_posters.php">Guidelines for Reviewers of Poster Submissions</a></li> 
  </ul>
  &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li> Access your assigned submission(s) through the submission viewing form 
<?php if ($reviewSiteReady) {
 echo $reviewerURL;
} else {
 echo "<em>submission viewing form (coming soon)</em>";
}
?>.  You may review the submission on-line or print it for review at your leisure.
  <p><strong class="note">If your browser does not open a submission automatically, try saving the file with a .pdf extension and opening it  with Adobe Reader (or another PDF file viewer).  </strong></p>
  <!-- See the <a href="/sigcse2013/faq/reviewers_faq.php">Reviewers FAQ section</a> for additional information.</strong></p> -->
  </li>
  <li>After reviewing, complete a report for each submission.  Submit Reviews by
<?php if ($reviewSiteReady) {
 echo $reviewerURL;
} else {
 echo "<em>review submission form (coming soon)</em>";
}
?>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note</em>: All reviews will be distributed anonymously to both the author(s) and reviewers of that submission. This will give the author feedback and provide information to reviewers as well.  It is hoped that, over time, this feedback will help make the review process more consistent as reviewers can compare their responses to those of others.</p>
